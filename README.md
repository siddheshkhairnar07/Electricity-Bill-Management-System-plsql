Project Description
This project is a Library Fine Calculation System developed using PL/SQL. The system is designed to automate the process of calculating fines for overdue books. It ensures that the fine calculations are accurate, efficient, and transparent. The system uses an Oracle database to store and manage student details, book information, and fine records. It automates the fine calculation based on the overdue period and the type of book.
